        \n\nTo whom it may concern,
        \n\nMy name is (NAME HERE). I took a questionnaire from Silver Lining, an application that
        measures one\'s level of depression, on %1$s. Out of a total score of 27, where 0 indicates
        no depression and 27 indicates severe depression, I received a %2$d. This result suggests
        that I have %3$s. %4$s
        \n\n%5$s%6$sI honestly %7$s myself making an appointment with a therapist or psychiatrist about this.
        \n\nSilver Lining would like to emphasize that its results are only meant for educational
        use and that it does not claim to be a clinical or diagnostic tool. However, they do wish
        to help and provide resources if possible, and they hope that this email can be of some
        service for you.
        \n\nAny help you can provide is appreciated.
        \nSincerely,
        \n(NAME HERE)
